# RuneScape VoS Notifier
Retrieves and displays the current Voice of Seren using the [JagexClock](https://twitter.com/jagexclock) Twitter account.

**Note:** This source does not contain the OAuth key/secret required by Twitter to retrieve the necessary Tweets. If you're compiling your own version, you will need to create a [Twitter App](http://apps.twitter.com/) to get your own key/secret set.

This program (when minimized) will appear on your system tray, and will provide notifications when the Voice of Seren changes districts. The notification will also appear with an exclamation mark and will last 60 seconds instead of 10 when one of the districts is Trahaearn.
